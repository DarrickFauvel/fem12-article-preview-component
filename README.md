## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- [CSS Open Props](https://open-props.style/) - Supercharged CSS variables
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Superfast bundling tool

### What I learned

I learned to use media queries to toggle a modified social sharing overlay when the share button is clicked. On a mobile screen size, the social icons slide in as a bar. On a desktop screen size, a kind of social tooltip flies out of the share button.

### Continued development

Apply more CSS Open Props.
